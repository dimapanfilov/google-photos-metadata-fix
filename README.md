# Google Photos Metadata Fix

## What is this?

When you export photos from Google Photos, does the exported folder contain photos with incorrect metadata and separate JSON files that contain the correct metadata?

This Python script inserts the correct metadata into each photo from the corresponding JSON file, then cleans up all the JSON files.

This project was inspired by [MetadataFixer.com](https://metadatafixer.com/), which is a paid version of the same thing. I am unaffiliated and wanted a free alternative, so I wrote this script.
